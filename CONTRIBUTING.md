### Installation

This project uses [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) as a monorepo package management tool.

First, install `lerna` globally for better repository maintenance:

```shell
npm i -g lerna
```

To install all dependencies the right way, run:

```shell
npm ci
```

To clear all installed dependencies, execute:

```shell
npm run clean
rm -rf node_modules
```

### Developing and Testing

Most of the time, you can use a package in the `packages` folder like a normal npm project.
If you want to run the command over all packages in parallel, ask lerna for help:

```shell
lerna run build --stream
```

Differences come up, if you want to add a dependency.
Here you must use lerna with the scope modifier:

```shell
lerna add [packageName] [packages/prefix-*]
```

Sometimes you need to edit the `package.json` manually.
You can add dependencies by simply adding the lines in the dependency object
and run lerna to restructure the monorepo dependencies:

```shell
lerna link convert
```

To add a dependency to a monorepo package,
use a file URI with a relative path to the package instead of a version number.
Lerna inserts at publishing the most recent version of the linked monorepo package automatically:

```json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"@wuespace/telestion-client-cli": "file:../telestion-client-cli"
	}
}
```

### Publishing

The publishing process, in this project, is fully automated. Please refer to the relevant sections of the _Telestion Client Git Conventions_ for further instructions on publishing.
