### Installation

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as package manager.

To install it, run:

```shell
npm install --global pnpm@next-7
```

To install production and development dependencies, run:

```shell
pnpm install
```

Before you begin to develop, you should build all packages for the first time:

```shell
pnpm build
```

Some tools don't work very well when no build files exist.

To clear all build files, execute:

```shell
pnpm clean
```

### Developing and Testing

Most of the time, you can use a package in the `packages` folder like a normal pnpm project.

Differences come up, if you want to add a dependency.
Here you need to use pnpm with the filter option:

```shell
pnpm add --filter "telestion-client-core" typescript@4.4.4
```

If you need a dependency in the root package, call pnpm with the root-workspace selector:

```shell
pnpm add --workspace-root fliegdoc@latest
```

To add a dependency to a monorepo package,
use the [workspace protocol](https://pnpm.io/workspaces#workspace-protocol-workspace)
with a version specifier to the package instead of a version number.
During publishing pnpm inserts the most recent version number of the linked monorepo package automatically:

```json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"@wuespace/telestion-client-cli": "workspace:^"
	}
}
```

Please check the [main `package.json`](./package.json) for more scripts.

### Build-Stack

We use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as our build tool for most of the monorepo packages.
Parcel has a configuration file named `.parcelrc`. Due to the nature of parcel as a zero-configuration build tool,
you don't need to change it very often.

### Publishing

The publishing process, in this project, is fully automated.
Please refer to the relevant sections in the
[internal Telestion documentation](https://docs.telestion.wuespace.de/internal/) for further instructions on publishing.
