# @wuespace/parcel-reporter-tc-cli

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- Move the monorepo build tooling to Parcel/`pnpm`

  This primarily affects the development within the `telestion-client` monorepo and shouldn't affect available APIs (unless otherwise specified in the changelog).

  It might, however, cause changes in the resulting format of the distributed files.

- Initial release as part of the Parcel migration
