Parcel Resolver that overrides any imports of [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) to include React only once and in one
version only.
This prevents React from failing with
the [Invalid Hook Call Warning](https://reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html#duplicate-react).

> Note: This plugin is only active if you're using a workspace linked project.

## Installation

If you're using
the [`@wuespace/telestion-client-template`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wuespace/telestion-client-template) the
plugin is already installed and integrated in Parcel.

If that's not the case, install the plugin as development dependency:

```shell
pnpm add -D @wuespace/parcel-resolver-react
# or
npm install --save-dev @wuespace/parcel-resolver-react
```

Then add it to your `.parcelrc` configuration:

```json
{
	"resolvers": ["@wuespace/parcel-resolver-react", "..."]
}
```

That's it!
