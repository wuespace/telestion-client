### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **cli:** PSC's now require a `telestion.config.js` file in the PSC's root directory (next to the `package.json`).

  ```js
  module.exports = {}
  ```

### [0.7.1](https://github.com/TelestionTeam/telestion-client/compare/v0.7.0...v0.7.1) (2021-02-06)

**Note:** Version bump only for package @wuespace/telestion-client-cli





## [0.7.0](https://github.com/TelestionTeam/telestion-client/compare/v0.6.1...v0.7.0) (2021-02-06)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **cli:** Before, running `tc-cli start` opened the PSC as an Electron app, by default. To replicate this behavior, you'll now have to pass the `--electron` or `-e` argument to the command.

In summary, replace `tc-cli start` with `tc-cli start -e` to keep the same behavior.

### Features

* **cli:** Add option to open the PSC in either an Electron window or a browser in `tc-cli start` ([5fd359c](https://github.com/TelestionTeam/telestion-client/commit/5fd359c6d5e04208be15c41e37a9c1612eb463b0))
