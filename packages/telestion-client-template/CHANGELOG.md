## [0.8.0](https://github.com/TelestionTeam/telestion-client/compare/v0.7.1...v0.8.0) (2021-02-08)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **template:** While, in and of itself, this doesn't constitute a breaking change, issues may arise in PSCs generated using the template before this change. This is why we want to bring special attention to it.

  To fix PSCs generated before with versions prior to this, add the following property to the PSC's `package.json`:

  ```json
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "react-app",
      "react-app/jest"
    ]
  }
  ```

  You won't have to do this steps for PSCs generated with the new version.
* **cli:** PSC's now require a `telestion.config.js` file in the PSC's root directory (next to the `package.json`).

  To migrate PSCs generated with older versions of the CLI, please add a `telestion.config.js` file with the following content into the root PSC directory, next to the `package.json`:
  ```js
  module.exports = {}
  ```
* **template:** Setting the `homepage` to `'.'` is required for building native applications from PSC projects using `tc-cli build`. For projects generated before this change, please manually add the following line to your PSC's `package.json`:
```json
"homepage": "."
```
