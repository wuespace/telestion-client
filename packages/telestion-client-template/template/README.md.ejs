This Telestion PSC (_Project-Specific Client_) was bootstrapped with the
[Telestion Client](https://github.com/TelestionTeam/telestion-client) CLI.

## Getting started

> **NOTE:** All commands below, unless otherwise specified,
> should get executed in the cloned project's root folder (that contains the `package.json`) or a subfolder thereof.

The first step is to install the development dependencies.
They are defined in `package.json` and you can install them with the following command:

```shell script
npm ci
```

## Running

To build and run the project in development mode, execute:

```shell script
npm start
```

## Build and deploy

The build command generates a ready-to-deploy web application and native app.

To build the entire project, run:

```shell script
npm run build
```
